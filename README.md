Protein
=======

Experimental logic container for web apps which encourages maintainability, readability, and rapid development.

In Protein, you act like the world is your state. Your view of the world changes as your state reacts to stimuli. Your visuals are rendered on every state change. That's it.

In other words, there are three concepts in Protein:

* **State:** The state of your application is one place. But *everything* is your state - your local state, your backend, your visuals, your background processes, and your environment.
* **Stimuli:** Outside forces act on your app, changing its state. Stimuli include user interactions, server responses, and environment changes.
* **Transitions:** Transitions are the logic on how state changes according to stimuli.

That's it.
